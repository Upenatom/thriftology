# Thriftology

*Thriftology* is a **community-based, used clothing web application** that brings you quality at an affordable price. As a user, you are able to both *buy* and *sell* thrifts.<br>The name Thriftology comes from the word "thrift" which is defined as a non-wasteful way to manage financial wants and needs.

## How it Works:

At first glance, the user is able to either **sign up, log in, or navigate** to the "All Thrifts" page. Here, the user can view **all** listings:

When attempting to **buy** a listing, the user will be prompted to **log in**.

When logged in, the user can choose to **add a new thrift** as shown below. After clicking the "Submit!" button, the page renders the **details** page, where the user can upload photos of the item (up to 3 at a time):

After uploading a photo(s), the user is able to view *their* **listed, sold, and bought thrifts**. The user is also able to make **edits** to each listed thrift when necessary (ie. change description, upload a new photo, etc.), or **delete** a listed thrift.
